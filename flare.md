Flare

I used Flare's Secure Random Number Generator to generate trustless, verifiable randomness for apple spawning in SlitherMoney. Since each game’s outcome directly affects real money (players stake USDC), we needed randomness that couldn’t be predicted, manipulated, or biased by either player (including me the developer). Flare gave us on-chain, tamper-proof entropy so every apple spawn is provably fair, making gameplay transparent and preventing any RNG-based exploits.

Additionally, we deployed our on-chain gaming smart contracts on flare.
